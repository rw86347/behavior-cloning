# behavior-cloning

Most of my code was written in model.py

# Goal

The goal was to be able to drive a car around a simulated course with only camera input to steer the car.

# Training data

This car ran on software built by Udacity.  It allows you to capture images and steering data to your hard drive. I am not good or enjoy video games, thus I ran off the road a lot.  I deceided that this was actually good in that I have lots of recovery data, but like a politition I need to hide my screw ups.  So I wrote an additional program that allowed me to delete my screw ups and train on doing things right.  This worked out very good.

# The Neural Net design

The neural net design was published by Nvidia.

# Outcome

Once the system was trained (12 hours).  I was able to drive 99% of the course.  I then added additional training data for when there were no lines on the road, and trained again.
